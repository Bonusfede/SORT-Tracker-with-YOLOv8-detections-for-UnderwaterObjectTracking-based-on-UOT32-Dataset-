# LSTM-LongShortTermMemory-Tracking-for-UnderwaterObjectTracking-based-on-UOT32-Dataset-
Implementation of a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) for tracking underwater objects. It aims to perform better than other tracking algorithms like SORT or deepSORT. It uses a locally trained YOLOv8 model as a detector on UOT32 dataset.
